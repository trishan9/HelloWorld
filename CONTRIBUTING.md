#### Procedure to add programs:

- Clone to repo to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/HelloWorld.git`
(Before committing all files, check if all files are staged atleast. It can be checked using `git status`).
- Make a new branch to make PR: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
- Add your programs in correct locations: `git add .`. (Adds all files here)
- Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Some_Random_Message"`. (Committed all files)
- Finally, you just need to push all the changes by doing: `git push origin <branch_name>`.
